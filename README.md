Binary Galois Field Polynomial Table Generator by using Primitive Polynomial

Maybe some of us asking about, how to generate a Binary Primitive Polynomial Table? Because if we do it manually it will take quite a long time especially for the high-order Galois Field.

To produce a Polynomial Binary Primitive Table now it's very easy, just use this simple program that can be opened with c ++. (recommended to use CodeBlocks for convenience)
